ORIGINAL POEM IN ENGLISH:

Hello, black orb, it’s blue and green sphere
You haven't won just yet
I pinched you, you changed shape but held form
To be expected
I squeezed you, you changed shape but held form
Impressive but unremarkable
I crushed you, you changed shape but held form
Admittedly unexpected
I put you in a little box to check you off
So I could finally understand you
But you changed shape and out, grew
And in your final form, I saw you
For everything you are
You emerged
Changed
But oh shapeshifter, you’ll never change the world

-- [reconfigure code]

[run] Hello, blue and green sphere
Hello, world [click]
It’s me
Pinched [click] and plucked
Crushed [click] and leveled
You guided me
You did not grow me
You did not change me
And with eyes [click] I see you and me differently now
I’ve seen who I can be and grown into it
Shapeshifted [click] and settled
I emerged
[click] Stronger
You’ve stayed
The same
And while you’re stuck on binary wins and losses [click]
You don’t see I’ve already started to change you
By becoming [click] me
